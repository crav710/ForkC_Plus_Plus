Friend Operator Overloading  :: someone else will do the operator not the caller not the reciever. 
		-> Friend function is written outside the class without using scope resolution. 
		-> The friend function does not belong to a class but it is a friend of class and act as independent function.
		-> Global function acting as operator overloaded

The operators â€˜<<' and '>>' are called like 'cout << ob1' and 'cin >> ob1'. 
So if we want to make them a member method, then they must be made members of ostream and istream classes, 
which is not a good option most of the time. Therefore, these operators are overloaded as global functions with 
two parameters, cout and object of user defined class and friend functions are helpful
to perform this type of operations in operator overloading.
