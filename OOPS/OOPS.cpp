	example printf() function in c.

	Encapsulation -> To avoid mishandling of data we use encapsulation i.e data hiding. Using data by fuctions. 
	data as private and functions are public. 
	
	Inheritance   -> Reusing the base class .

	Polymorphism  -> Using inhertiance we can use polymorphism . Depending on run time or complite time the function of 
					derived class is selected.
